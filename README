* Create directories:
          build/
          build/test/
          build/gtest/
          lib/
          data/(base|tgs|rvi|bow)
* Symlink gtest/ to gtest source, tested with v1.6.0
* Perhaps modify the SConstruct file if opencv is not found by default when linking
* Build with 'scons'
* If you wish to create the card feature database, extract the card images
  into the folder assets/ and make sure they are sorted according to the expansion
  in assets/base, assets/tgs, ...
  Then run ./rftgscore features to generate the database into data/*
